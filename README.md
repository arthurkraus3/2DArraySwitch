## 2D Array Row/Col Switch
DO NOT COPY/PASTE/RUN.. If you need to steal code off the internet for this kind of program, you should actually take the time and learn how it all works. I recommend taking the ConvertArrayNotes and the ConvertArrayMain FIRST, then if you ABSOLUTELY NEED something to reference, then look at ConvertArray.java and use it to learn off of what you do wrong. Hopefully, you wont need it and I have provided enough on ConvertArrayNotes. 


### Goal
Take an integers such as: 
```
12, 23, 34
44, 53, 62
```
Transformed into: 
```
12, 44
23, 53
34, 62
```
I made notes for those who would like to understand more about how to do this easily.
NO CODE STEALING PLEASE.
